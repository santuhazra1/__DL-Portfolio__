The goal of this project is to create a farmework for end 2 end image classification for any kind of Custom Dataset as well as CIFAR10 dataset. Below are the features of this framework

- Use ResNet-34 model pre-trained on the imagenet dataset
- Transfer Learning
- Use of Custom Animal DataSet from here
- CIFAR10 Dataset
- gradCam

Once done we will be able to see correctly classified images and their gradcam images.
