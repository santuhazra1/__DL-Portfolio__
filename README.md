I can work really well when it comes to Computer Vision, Python projects, and anything with C++/C and Linux, from creating custom DNNs and creating a deployment pipeline to creating a high performance solution, I am the guy for it. This repository contains state of the art open source Deep Learning Projects experimented by me.

## Please find the below project details:

### Face Alignment and Face Swap

Using dlib to build a face alignment and a face swap model and deploying it on AWS Lambda. To see the code go [here](03%20-%20Face%20Recognition%20Part%201).

### Face Recognition

Using InceptionResnet to train a face recognition model using transfer learning and deploying it on AWS Lambda. To see the code go [here](04%20-%20Face%20Recognition%20Part%202).

### Human Pose Estimation

Deploy a pre-trained monocular human pose estimation model to AWS Lambda and write a summary of the paper **Simple Baselines for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking**. To see the code go [here](05%20-%20Human%20Pose%20Estimation).

### Generative Advesarial Network

Deploy a GAN which generates Indian Car Images. To see the code go [here](06%20-%20GAN)

### Variational AutoEncoders

Deploy a VAE which can reconstruct Indian Car Images. To see the code go [here](07%20-%20VAE)

### Image Super-Resolution and Neural Style Transfer

Deploy a SRGAN model which can improve small drone images and also deploy a neural style transfer model. To see the code go [here](08%20-%20SRGAN%20and%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer)

### Neural Embedding

Deploy a sentiment analysis model which can detect whether a given movie review is positive or negative. To see the code go [here](09%20-%20Neural%20Embedding)

### GRU, Attention Mechanism & Transformers

Deploy a model which can translate German sentences into English. To see the code go [here](11%20-%20Attention%20Mechanism)
